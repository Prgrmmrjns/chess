# This is a Python Chess game 

## Credits
* This Python app is my version of the chess game created by AlejoG10 (https://github.com/AlejoG10/python-chess-ai-yt)

## Requirements
* Python >= 3.9
* Installed packages: Pygame, Pygame_menu, Numpy

## Tips
* Change settings: The application starts with the Pygame menu where one can change settings including mode, 
player color, music preferences and promotion settings
* Default settings: 
  * AI vs Player
  * Player color = white
  * Music = mixed
  * Promotion = queen
* During the game the m button can be pressed to go back to the menu
* If you want to create an exe file from the game I suggest the package "auto-py-to-exe"

## Next steps
* Make a timer
* Sidebar to change settings without opening the menu
* Improve the AI, e.g. using deep learning
* Allow the user to implement some AI settings and have an AI battle
* Connect to Stockfish API
* Bring the chess app to the web browser
* Online Multiplayer mode


If you have any suggestions how I can implement the next steps or if you have any feedback please contact me!
Have fun with my game!
